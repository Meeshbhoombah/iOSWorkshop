# iOS Workshop
Learn the basics of Swift 3, Xcode, and handling errors by building a simple Calculator application.

Before we start building the Calculator, we need to understand how to use Swift. Coincidentally, Apple just released Swift 3 and the non-beta version of Xcode 8 this week (alongside the launch of its new products). We'll cover the fundamentals of Swift 3 so that you have a solid foundation to follow.

## Swift Basics
Swift is a easy language to understand. It has a clean, more modern, synxtax then it's predecessory, Objective-C, and it's use casses are endless. Not only

To learn Swift we'll create a new Playground. As the name suggests, this will enable us to play around with Swift. With Xcode open, navigate to `File > New > Playground`.

Let's start off by simply printing "Hello, World!" Swift allows us to accomplish this with one line `print("Hello, World!")` You can see `"Hello, World!"` outputted on the righthand side of the screen.

## Variables
As with every programming language, Swift enables users to create variables. Use the keyword `var` to declare a variable.
```Swift
var myFirstVariable: String = "Hello, World!"
```

## Calculator
We'll start by creating a new project. With Xcode open, navigate to `File > New > Project`.
